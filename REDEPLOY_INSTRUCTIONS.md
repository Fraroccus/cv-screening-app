# Force Vercel Redeploy

## Method 1: Through Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: cv-screening-app-sand
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## Method 2: Push a Small Change
Create a small change to trigger auto-deployment:

1. Edit any file (add a comment)
2. Commit and push
3. Vercel will auto-deploy

## Method 3: Check Build Logs
If the component still doesn't show:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check the latest deployment logs
3. Look for any build errors related to SharePointURLUpload

## What to Look For
The SharePoint URL Processing component should appear as:
- Yellow background box
- Title: "SharePoint URL Processing"
- Instructions on how to copy SharePoint URLs
- Large textarea for pasting URLs
- Blue "Process SharePoint Files" button

## Immediate Test
Test on local first:
- http://localhost:3000
- Login: admin/ITSMAKER
- Component should be between blue SharePoint box and main upload area
